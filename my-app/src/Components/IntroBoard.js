      AAC stands for Augmentative and Alternative Communication, a set of
      tools and strategies helping individuals with communication
      difficulties express themselves. From low-tech options like picture
      boards to high-tech devices and software, AAC enhances or
      supplements verbal communication for those with conditions like
      autism or speech disorders, fostering inclusivity and enabling
      active participation in various aspects of life.
